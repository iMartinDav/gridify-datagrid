Gridify Datagrid is a lightweight and versatile React component designed for efficiently displaying tabular data in web applications. It offers powerful features to redefine what a grid can do, including sorting, filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to provide detailed insights. Performance is guaranteed, ensuring smooth user experience even with large datasets.

## Installation

You can install Gridify Datagrid via npm:

```bash
npm install gridify-datagrid
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import GridifyDatagrid from 'gridify-datagrid';

const columns = [
  { id: 0, name: "Name" },
  { id: 1, name: "Description" },
];

const data = [
  { id: 0, 0: "Sam Altman", 1: "CEO @ Open AI" },
  { id: 1, 0: "Elon Musk", 2: "CEO @ Tesla" },
  { id: 2, 0: "Jeff Bezos", 3: "Founder, Amazon" },
];

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Gridify Datagrid Example</h1>
      <GridifyDatagrid data={data} columns={columns} />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

Replace `data` and `columns` with your actual data and column definitions.

Gridify Datagrid is a lightweight and versatile React component designed for efficiently displaying tabular data in web applications. It is compatible with various React frameworks and offers seamless integration.

## Installation

You can install Gridify Datagrid via npm:

```bash
npm install gridify-datagrid
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import GridifyDatagrid from 'gridify-datagrid';

const columns = [
  { id: 0, name: "Name" },
  { id: 1, name: "Description" },
];

const data = [
  { id: 0, 0: "Sam Altman", 1: "CEO @ Open AI" },
  { id: 1, 0: "Elon Musk", 2: "CEO @ Tesla" },
  { id: 2, 0: "Jeff Bezos", 3: "Founder, Amazon" },
];

function App() {
  return (
    <div>

      <GridifyDatagrid data={data} columns={columns} />
